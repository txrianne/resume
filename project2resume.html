    <br><h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a Java GUI application that simulates an e-commerce store. The application allows users to search for items (based on an inventory CSV file), add/delete items to a shopping cart, and generate an invoice that includes discounts and tax. Each transaction is recorded in a CSV file. This project allowed me to learn how to implement Java Swing to create a GUI that responds to the users' actions, manage data, and store and retrieve data using CSV files in Java.   </p>
